        * Modified xmlcollector-vmax-topo.xml to include collector configuration for DMX masking using 'symmaskdb' command
        * Modified xmlcollector-vmax-topo.xml to enhances VMAX-ACCESS collector configuration to produce new metric "MappingData" to simplify creation of IOPath objects.
        * Modified xmlcollector-vmax-topo.xml to enhances VMAX-ACCESS collector configuration to include 'masked'/'mapped' properties in existing masking rawvalues as 
          Topology expects them to be 'true/false', rather than '1/0'
        * Modified vhf-topobe.xml to include 'UsedCapacity' metric to push "isused" property of LUN to TopologBE
        * Modified vhf-topobe.xml to convert the hexadecimal number into decimal for 'hostlun' - logical unit number

 * collect: Add LUN metric properties for ispolcsu and fix isbound property to be based on tdev_status
 * collect: Add Storage Pool metric properties for poolname and pooltype.
 * collect: Add isfast property based on count of LUNs bound to it which are FAST-managed.  Have to do this in several steps to use CRF to copy latest isfast value to
            all Storage Pool metrics:
        * Add new SAH to count number of FAST managed LUNs bound to each Storage Pool (FastLunCount) groupby poolname.
        * If FastLunCount metric does not exist then force metric value to zero using MAX.
        * PAH logic to base isfast on FastLunCount: if FastLunCount > 0 then set isfast=1 else isfast=0
        * copy Storage Pool poolname to part on FastLunCount
        * Add PTF to remove Storage Pool isfast property (reset it to null) so we can rely on CRF.  This is needed in the event that the
          FAST-managed LUNs are later bound to a different Thin Pool.
        * Use CRF to copy FastLunCount latest isfast value to other Storage Pool metrics.
 * collect: add new Storage Pool metrics:  EnabledCapacity, PoolUsableCapacity, PoolSubscribedCapacity, PoolOversubscribedCapacity
 * collect: Added usedby ("File" | "Block") to LUNs and replica LUNs
 * collect: Added topology mappings
 * collect: Removed PTF JDBC accessors for getting Thick and Thin LUN disk characteristics
        * Added cross-reference in crf-vmax1.xml on disk group to get Thick LUN disk characteristics
        * Added PTF Property Accessor in ptf-vmax-thindisk.xml to get Thin LUN disk characteristics
 * collect: Added cross-reference in crf-vmax-pool-diskinfo.xml to cross reference pool contributor disk characteristics with the bound Storage Pool
 * collect: Removed 'isused-rootlun.csv' PTF file as 'isused' now comes from SPARQL Accessor PTF for replica chain
            * Added 'ismasked' and 'ismapped' flags for DMXMasking metric for LUN parttype, so UsedCapacity metric can be calculated correctly.
            * Modified the order of XML Collector commands so the the initial order of arguments are always of the format 'cmd -output xml -sid (host) ....'
            * Modified vmax.cmd.ftl and vmax.sh.ftl to hide the error and display empty XML for 'symmaskdb' command so that the errors are not shown for this command for
              VMAX arrays which is expected. For all other commands everything else has to behave the same way. Caveat for this is even if 'symmaskdb' command fails for
              DMX array for any reason, that wouldn't be caught as an error, rather that has to be troubleshooted with missing data.
 * collect: Added ThickLunCapacity, ThickLunUsedCapacity, ThickLunFreeCapacity
 * collect: Changed StorageGroup RemoveMe metric to SGLunCapacity
 * collect: Fixed problems with SystemUsedCapacity, HotSpareCapacity, PoolSubscribedCapacity, PoolOversubscribedCapacity metrics
 * collect: Added VDEV and DLDEV UsedCapacity metrics and set to zero

        * Added 'feport' property which is concatenated string of director and port to VMAX-PORTS configuration
        * Included 2 new perl scripts that manipulates Solutions Enabler Event Daemon configuration - Users can download these and run on SE to configure Alerting.
 * collect: bug fixes
        * Changed dgraid Xpath expression due to problems when with getting RAID level for remote replicas.
        * Changed poolname XPath expression so that TDEVs would have a poolname value for Capacity metric
        * Fixed Array UsedCapacity calculation
        * Changed BlockUsedCapacity calculation to be based on FileUsedCapacity
        * Fixed default LUN purpose tagging used when topology service is not present by adding new CRF and changing CRF/PTF filter sequence

        * Changed VMAX microcode string
        * Added partid to all LUN metrics
        * Added Storage Pool UsedFileCapacity and UsedBlockCapacity

        * Added CRF for pooltype to get it added to LUN metrics
        * Exclude other DEFAULT_POOL snap pools except for the FBA emulation. No longer need additions to DEFAULT_POOL part property to get unique values.
 * report:
        * Fixed FileUsedCapacity in Usable Capacity Details report
        * Fixed FreeCapacity in Usable Capacity Trend Details report
